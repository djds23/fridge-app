TODO:
  * Just make a category component with a grocerylist child for consistency 
  * 0,1,5 do not make sense for quantity codes, use something like 100,200,300
  * update `GroceryList` component to take a name param and match new schema
  * make consistent naming between `household_id` and `house_hold_id`
  * add categories with their own sections and subsections
  * easier to use /new/ form (add category to form)
  * way to hide/delete old groceries
  * a detailed view you should hold or double tap to navigate to
  * unit tests
  * deployment with capistrano

DONE:
  * use sprockets for js / scss
  * write front end in react
  * have swipe events change state in backend
